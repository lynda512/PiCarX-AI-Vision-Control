1. Drive car around manually and take photos

2. Drive car manually and record video
    a. Use sampling at 5 fps to retrieve images - keep it low to avoid similar images
    b. Use higher fps for detailed analysis - risks of similar images


After that is done, we can consider:
1. Save images with timestamp and "driver's activity" (turning, staying still, going straight, etc..)
2. Data augmentation - adding artificial shifts and rotations
    to teach the network how to recover from a poor position or orientation
